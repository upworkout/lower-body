P90X Shoulders and Arms &#43; Ab Ripper X Arnel Banawa From arnelbanawa.blogspot.com
Everytime i have gone through p90x, i always did ab ripper right after the workout. Stretch while your muscles are still warm. The big difference here is that the p90x workouts are much longer than the power 90 or the p90x3 workouts. Ive been doing ab ripper x 3x a week for 10 months now, and i just took a month break from it and can still come back and do it almost just as if i didnt stop.
