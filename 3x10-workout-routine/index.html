<p>Reps of like 10 like in the 3x10 your basically working hyphertrophy which is for putting more stress on those muscles. If you were able to get all 10 reps across all three sets, add some weight on the next workout with that exercise, and work to progress the new, heavier weight up to 3x10. You will gain mass though regardless as long as your eating right and lifting hard. Im no expert but from everything ive read, experience, friends, and local gym heads, 5x5 helps you build strength.</p>
