But in addition to a huge time commitment, p90x also requires more equipment than body beast and insanity combined. I intend on swapping out the yoga, plyo, and maybe kenpo of p90x with insanity. I also used interval cardio and accessories to increase intensity including a weighted vest for pushups and pullups, weighted gloves for martial arts, ankle weights for abs and pushup stands to expand range of motion for pushups. However, it was expected since i was already in a somewhat decent shape when i started the hybrid program.
