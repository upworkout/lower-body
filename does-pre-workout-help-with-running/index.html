What�s the deal with running after leg day? From hussle.com
Some sort of stretching is very important prior to running or any exercise for both injury prevention, as well as to improve the quality of your workout. For instance, a 2012 study in the journal of strength conditioning and resistance. It uses quality ingredients and natural extracts not commonly seen in the industry such as beetroot juice powder and schisandra chinensis berry extract. However, the generic term “stretching” includes different types of exercises.
