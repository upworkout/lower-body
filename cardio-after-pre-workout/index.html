Should You Do Cardio Before Or After Your Workout? From an.athletenetwork.com
It’s there to assist your muscle endurance. Whether you want to gain muscle and power, improve your body composition, or just feel stronger in your daily activities, you should hit the weight room before the treadmill if you plan on doing both cardio and strength training in a single session. Not simply by serving to your positive aspects, it may be particularly good for hiit exercises too. If your goal is increasing muscle mass, but time is an issue, feel free to add some cardio exercise after your weight training session.
